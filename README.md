# Next Launch ðŸš€

Are you ready to launch your next Next project?

This starter kit contains everything you need to launch your project into production, quickly.

This [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), and modified to include all of the bells and whistles needed to deliver production ready web applications, fast.

## Create repository

Create a repository based on this template.

Clone the new repo locally.

Periodically, the template will get updates. If the updates in the template are desired, pull the changes from the template to the new repo. See ["GitHub - Pull changes from a template repository" on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56577320).

Add the template repository as a remote

``` sh
git remote add template git@github.com:generalui/next-launch.git
```

Now it is possible to merge branches from the template to the new repo:

``` sh
git merge template/[branch to merge] --allow-unrelated-histories
```
